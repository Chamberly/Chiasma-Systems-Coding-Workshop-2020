# Chiasma-Systems-Coding-Workshop-2020
Chiasma Auckland's Coding Workshop in 2020, at the University of Auckland

# Hello there!

Welcome to Chiasma's Coding Workshop for 2020. It's great to see you here. 

Regardless of whether you've coded before or study a tech-related degree, this workshop is here to teach you the basics of programming through Python - a language that is useful for so many things including making games, artificial intelligence, websites and analytics. In this workshop, we will first teach you the basic syntax, then progress to making a Tic-Tac-Toe simulation that you can show off to your mates! Our aim is to at least get you comfortable with what programming entails.

# Print statements

Want to send a happy birthday message to a friend next to you? You've come to the right place.

Python's print statements allow you to write messages to your system console.

For "Happy birthday!", this can be done using print("Happy birthday!").

To sing Adele's song, just do print("Hello").

Et cetera...
